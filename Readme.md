# CovidExod.us

*Project*

_Summary_

Our Project consists on the construction of a metropolitan exodus simulator (covidexod.us), based on an integrated assessment of environmental and socioeconomic data, within the pandemic. The solution offers a website with awareness on the reduction of pollution, dismantling of big metropolitan areas and promotion of a match between companies and candidates looking for remote work. Companies dismobilizing their office would be eligible for a “seal” – Green Places to Work.
How We Addressed This Challenge
We adressed the integrated assesment challenge by incorporating COVID-19 spread data, carbon monoxide monitoring and population density from NASA´s Earth Observatory. We integrated health parameters (COVID-19), with environmental (CO) and socioeconomic data to help citizens and companies making better decisions leaving big urban centers. Our idea is that with remote work being a reality, companies and citizens will be more prone to leaving big urban centers, bettering their quality of life, diminishing their carbon footprint and slowing down COVID-19 spread. 

_How We Developed This Project_

This challenge inspired us to believe in a great future for the world, trying to absorb the best from this present pandemic situation and wait for great aspirations in the future. Knowledge is not developed without evaluating the situation and the results from an applied scientific methodology. In this case, the opportunity to explore the associations between the  impact of carbon gases and the spread of Covid-19 in the urban areas made us trust in this challenge. With the pandemic, we realized remote work would be a great solution and that has many impacts: environmental, socioeconomic and in health (COVID-19 spread). We took advantage of some planning tools like Crazy 8s and 5w 2h to better understand the problem and solution, and find viable pathways to the endgame. We used space agency data from the NASA Earth observatory carbon monoxide map database. To program we have used: HTML 5 - CSS3 - JAVASCRIPT  - PYTHON as well as some graphic imagery from Tableau. We are also integrating a chatbot through CHATFUEL + INTEGROMAT. We have realized that crowded urban spaces can be major sources of SARS diseases spread. Also the advent of modern technology we propose that the world can work in a different manner, and populations will not need to be gathered in big urban centers. A great part of them can move away to smaller cities, balancing populations around the world.
